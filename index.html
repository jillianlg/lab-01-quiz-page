            <p>A West Coast native-born in Southern California, I was raised on the beaches of Santa Barbara and in the
                mountains of Washington. After a 9-year stint on the East Coast, I returned to the PNW and planted roots
                where I'd left my heart.</p>
            <p>I love spending time outdoors. You can find me hitting the slopes with my snowboard, backpacking or
                hiking, running, rock climbing, at the river with the dog, or even kayaking on occasion. If the
                weatherisn't cooperating, you will likely find me curled up on the couch either reading a good book or
                binge-watching the latest show. I love adventure travel and am always looking for the next escapade.
                Hoping this career pivot to software engineer will allow my schedule to be a bit more flexible so I can
                start checking off some of my bucket list adventures. Such as; backpacking through the Alps, exploring
                South America's rain forests, seeing the Nothern Lights in Iceland while sleeping in an igloo,
                Cayonyering in Costa Rica, or finally getting to complete the Kalalau Trail on the Napali Coast!</p>
            <p>My career path has lent to a unique adventure as well! Over the last twenty-three years, I have provided
                medical care in the US Navy, worked as a barista, and launched a marking and branding company. While
                pursuing a directing MFA, I created a sensory-integrated Theater and managed a 500-seat Performing Arts
                Center. A few years back, I switched from the theatre track and landed in event management. I oversaw
                cross-functional teams in the pre-planning and implementing small C-level summits to large (65k)
                conferences until COVID-19 hit.</p>
